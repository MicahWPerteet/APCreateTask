## I. Main Idea
Gambling/slot machine game where you start with a set amount of money and try to make as much money as possible, without running out of money.  
The game will be a roguelike, so there will be no saving progress, and you will start with a set amount of money on each playthrough.

## II. Core Gameplay Loop
1. Start off with a certain amount of money  
2. Spin slot machine  
3. Make/lose money  
4. Spend money on “upgrades” which can increase your chances of making money, make you spin faster, or allow you to auto spin.

## CT Days Log

**Day 1:**  
Set up GitHub repository, created boilerplate code for pygame, and brainstormed some ideas.  

**Day 2:**  
Found a library for creating menus with pygame, setup a basic main menu and pause screen, brainstormed some more concepts for the CGL, and looked at reference art.  

**Day 3:**  
Finished making the functional main menu and pause menu, started blocking out the main game screen layout, and began creating the art for the slot machine.
